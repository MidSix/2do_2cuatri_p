# Let me explain this .gitignore
# It's a very helpful approach to have everything about a subject inside
# just one folder. This .gitignore basically tells git to ignore
# EVERYTHING inside the folder except for the p (practice) directory of
# each subject. So you can have whatever you want inside the subject
# folder and as long as is not inside p folder is goona be ignored
# and won't be eligible for versioninig. With this you can have for
# example inside FAA a folder for the theory pdf's, another folder for
# test code, whatever. And those folders won't be tracked, I really
# found this usefull, so it's not an error to not
# ignore this .gitignore.

# So because of this configuration, anything added outside
# of p folder in each subject will be ignored for versioning.
# That includes changing the name of the folder from p -> whatever.
# So please don't change the name of p folder.

# Same goes for the names of each subject folder. If the names are
# changed then the filter won't work and everything will be ignored
# for versioning.
